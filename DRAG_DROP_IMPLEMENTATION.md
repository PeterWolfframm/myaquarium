# Drag & Drop Object Placement Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented drag-and-drop functionality to place sprites as 6x6 cube objects in the aquarium grid system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Object Management System
- **ObjectManager Class** (`/src/classes/Object.js`)
  - Manages placed objects in the aquarium
  - Handles 6x6 grid-based placement logic
  - Tracks grid occupancy to prevent overlaps
  - Supports object loading from database
  - Automatic fallback sprites for failed image loads

- **AquariumObject Class** (`/src/classes/Object.js`)
  - Represents individual placed objects
  - Handles PIXI sprite creation and scaling
  - Maintains grid position and world coordinates
  - Scales sprites to fit 6x6 tile areas while preserving aspect ratio

### 2. Database Integration
- **Database Schema** (`/src/database/objects_schema.sql`)
  - New `placed_objects` table with RLS policies
  - Stores object placement data with user association
  - Automatic timestamp tracking

- **Database Service Extensions** (`/src/services/database.js`)
  - Methods to save, load, update, and delete placed objects
  - Full CRUD operations with user authentication

### 3. Drag & Drop Interface
- **Draggable Sprites** (`/src/components/ObjectsSpriteGallery.jsx`)
  - Made object sprites draggable using @dnd-kit/core
  - Visual feedback during drag operations
  - Hover effects and drag hints

- **Drop Zone** (`/src/components/AquariumContainer.jsx`)
  - Aquarium canvas as drop target
  - Visual overlay during drag-over
  - Screen-to-world coordinate conversion

- **Drop Handling** (`/src/components/DragAndDropProvider.jsx`, `/src/App.jsx`)
  - Custom event system for object placement
  - Automatic coordinate translation
  - Success/failure feedback

### 4. Visual Features
- **CSS Styling** (`/src/styles.css`)
  - Drag cursor states (grab/grabbing)
  - Dragging visual feedback (opacity, scale)
  - Drop zone overlay with pulsing border animation
  - Hover effects for sprite gallery

### 5. Aquarium Integration
- **Layer Management** (`/src/classes/Aquarium.js`)
  - Objects render between background and fish layers
  - Proper z-index ordering
  - Integration with existing managers

## How It Works

1. **User Experience:**
   - Open Objects Manager panel
   - Upload or select an object sprite
   - Drag the sprite from the gallery
   - Drop it onto the aquarium canvas
   - Object automatically places in nearest available 6x6 grid space

2. **Technical Flow:**
   - Drag starts in `ObjectsSpriteGallery` with sprite data
   - Drop detected in `AquariumContainer` drop zone
   - Event bubbles up to `App` component
   - Screen coordinates converted to world coordinates
   - `ObjectManager` finds nearest available 6x6 grid space
   - Object created and added to aquarium
   - Database persistence happens automatically

3. **Grid System:**
   - Objects occupy 6x6 tiles (384x384 pixels at 64px/tile)
   - Smart placement finds nearest available space if exact drop location is occupied
   - Collision detection prevents overlapping objects
   - Objects maintain aspect ratio while fitting grid space

## Database Setup Required

Run the SQL commands in `/src/database/objects_schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor to create the necessary database table and policies.

## Key Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `/src/classes/Object.js` - Object management system
- `/src/database/objects_schema.sql` - Database schema

### Modified Files:
- `/src/services/database.js` - Added object persistence methods
- `/src/classes/Aquarium.js` - Integrated ObjectManager
- `/src/components/ObjectsSpriteGallery.jsx` - Made sprites draggable
- `/src/components/AquariumContainer.jsx` - Added drop zone
- `/src/components/DragAndDropProvider.jsx` - Added drop handling
- `/src/App.jsx` - Added object placement logic
- `/src/styles.css` - Added drag & drop styling

## Testing the Feature

1. Start the application
2. Open the Objects Manager (ðŸŽ¨ Objects button)
3. Upload an object sprite or use existing ones
4. Drag a sprite from the gallery onto the aquarium
5. Object should appear as a 6x6 cube in the nearest available grid position
6. Objects persist across browser sessions via database

The implementation provides a smooth, intuitive drag-and-drop experience while maintaining the aquarium's existing grid-based design philosophy.
